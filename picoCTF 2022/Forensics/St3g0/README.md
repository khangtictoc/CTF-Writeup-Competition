**Hint**: We know the end sequence of the message will be $t3g0.

### Solution: üíØ

With the hint, we know this type is "LSB steganography". I reference a blog here to solve this challeng and FYI: https://blog.katastros.com/a?ID=01800-ffe13f08-1b4e-4d2b-a7e3-a85d5a5afb96

He also provide a tool we can use easily. I also save the [Python Code Solve](Decode_LSB_Steganography.py). Install required library and run it.

**NOTE: This is a quick-use tool. If you want, you should learn and find out the algorithm, the working flow of this kind of steganography as well as find out how to decode it.**
