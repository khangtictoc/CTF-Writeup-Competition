# Redaction gone wrong‚ùì

**Tags:** Forensics

**Point:** 100 points

**Description:** 
Now you DON‚ÄôT see me.
[This](Financial_Report_for_ABC_Labs.pdf) report has some critical data in it, some of which have been redacted correctly, while some were not. Can you find an important key that was not redacted properly?

### Solution: üíØ

The description also contains hints to solve the problem - "some of which have been redacted correctly, while some were not.". Open file with any **PDF Editor** and search for `picoCTF`.

There's 1 result and it's in the end of file,  "fake-redacted" string.

**NOTE: For those who don't know how to copy this string. We just need to drag the mouse from start to end in that "black box"**
